# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial local build.

- Recommend & Insert sidebar: hardware-aware form over `veloxquant_mlx
  recommend --json`, with distinct UI states for not-installed,
  no-interpreter, unsupported-version, non-Darwin, and generic CLI failures.
- Insert-into-editor snippet builder with a target picker across open Python
  files, falling back to clipboard.
- Compression Lab editor panel backed by the local `veloxquant_mlx panel`
  control-plane server, with a hosted-playground fallback opened in the
  system browser.
- Guardrail on Compression Lab dispose: warns before stopping a spawned
  panel process if a real inference server is still running under it.
